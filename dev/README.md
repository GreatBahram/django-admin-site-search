# Dev

This directory holds a basic Django project, with multiple apps and models, 
to allow for easy local development and testing.

The theme is "football"; hence the "player", "stadiums", "teams" apps. 

[Factories](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/orms.html) are configured for each model, 
for testing, and to populate your local database.
